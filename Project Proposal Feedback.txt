Looks like a good project 2. For this project, the game does not have to be very big.
You don't show the "Go on a quest" option but if that's a short story adventure, then 
it just needs to be a few turns long. You also propose a graphical user interface (GUI) 
extra credit. If neither of you have programmed GUIs before, I'd suggest either starting 
early or not working on it at all. GUIs can be difficult and we will only talk about them 
in class after all of the required topics have been covered (GUIs are optional).
